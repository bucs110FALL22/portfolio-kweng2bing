# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
A simple tictactoe game made with import turtle. I know there are better ways to make it, but the assignment requres turtle so my only choice was to make it with turtle.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Players can choose to fill in a box more than once. In other words, player 1 and player 2 can both choose a1.
Also, if you type something incorrectly it will kick you out of the program.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
Interactive so please don't assume this program is only drawing  4 lines. This project kind of deviates from the purpose of the assingment which was to draw something, but it's nice to create a tic tac toe game. Also, unique in my opinion. 
I was thinking of also making an AI bot to go along with the program, but I do not have enough time. I will probably do it in my free time.
