# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
One of the api generates a list of possible mangas to read. Thsi gives user some perferance in what to read. The other api downloads the images of a specific chapter of the manga into the folder called 'Mangadex'. Note: The chapter downloaded is a little random.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
I notice that that api_one doesn't work super weel with popular anime mangas. You can try a few but there should be some that work. I know it doesn't work for: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach.
Listing a few that I tested and it worked( Death Note, Code Geass)
I am not confident that all the manga from api_two works for api_one. There are some that does work (ex. Darwin Incidient, Origin )
